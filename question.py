# - What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
#   something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
#   when others do the same for your code?

#I look for code that is easy to read, meaning the variables are properly named, proper indentation, and understandable comments and flow. The code should
# be easy to follow, understand, and applied imidiately.

#Containerization has revolutionized the way we can build easily shippable products. It helps us cherry pick virtual machine operating systems, environments, and packages
# that are needed are a particular software end-product.
